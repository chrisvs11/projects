In this practice the word“accurate” applied to a testing machine is used withoutnumerical values. For example, “An accurate testing machinewas used for the investigation.” The accuracy of a testingmachine should not be confused with sensitivity. For example,a testing machine might be very sensitive; that is, it mightindicate quickly and deﬁnitely small changes in torque, butnevertheless, be very inaccurate. On the other hand, theaccuracy of the results is in general limited by the sensitivity.\\n3.1.2 error, n— for a measurement or reading, the amount it\\ndeviates from a known or reference value represented by ameasurement standard. Mathematically, the error is calculatedby subtracting the accepted value from the measurement orreading.\\n3.1.2.1 Discussion— The word “error” shall be used with\\nnumerical values, for example, “At a torque of 3000 lbf·in., theerror of the testing machine was +10 lbf·in.”\\n3.1.3 percent error, n— in the case of a testing machine or\\ndevice, the ratio, expressed as a percent, of an error to theknown accepted value represented by a measurement standard.\\n3.1.4 reference standard, n— an item, typically a material or\\nan instrument, that has been characterized by recognizedstandards or testing laboratories, for some of its physical ormechanical properties, and that is generally used for calibrationor veriﬁcation, or both, of a measurement system or forevaluating a test method.\\n3.1.4.1 Discussion— Torque may be generated by a length\\ncalibrated arm and calibrated masses used to produce knowntorque. Alternatively, torque applied to a torque measuringdevice to be calibrated may be measured by the use of areference torque measurement device, that is, an elastic torquecalibration device, or a length calibrated arm and an elasticforce measuring device.\\n3.1.5 resolution, n— for a particular measurement device,\\nthe smallest change in the quantity being measured that causesa perceptible change in the corresponding indication.\\n3.1.5.1 Discussion— Resolution may depend on the value\\n(magnitude) of the quantity being measured.\\n3.1.5.2 Discussion— For paper charts or analog indicators,\\nthe resolution should not be assumed to be better (smaller) than1⁄10 of the spacing between graduations. For digital devices,\\nthe best resolution potentially achievable is the smallestdifference between two different readings given by the display.\\n3.1.5.3 Discussion— For both analog and digital devices, the\\nactual resolution can be signiﬁcantly poorer than describedabove, due to factors such as noise, friction, etc.\\n3.1.6 torque, n— a moment (of forces) that produces or tends\\nto produce rotation or torsion.\\n3.2 Deﬁnitions of Terms Speciﬁc to This Standard:\\n3.2.1 calibrated range of torque—in the case of testing\\nmachines , the range of indicated torque for which the testing\\nmachine gives results within the permissible variations speci-ﬁed.3.2.2 calibration torque— a torque with metrological trace-\\nability derived from standards of mass and length and ofspeciﬁc uncertainty of measurement, which can be applied totorque measuring devices.\\n3.2.3 capacity range—in the case of testing machines , the\\nrange of torque for which it is designed.\\n3.2.3.1 Discussion— Some testing machines have more than\\none capacity range, that is, multiple ranges.\\n3.2.4 correction—in the case of testing machines , the\\ndifference obtained by subtracting the indicated torque fromthe reference value of the applied torque.\\n3.2.5 elastic torque-measuring device— a device or system\\nconsisting of an elastic member combined with a device forindicating the measured values (or a quantity proportional tothe measured value) of deformation of the member under anapplied torque.\\n3.2.5.1 Discussion— The instrumentation for the elastic de-\\nvices may be either an electrical or a mechanical device, that is,a scale or pointer system.\\n3.2.6 expanded uncertainty— a statistical measurement of\\nthe probable limits of error of a measurement, NIST TechnicalNote 1297 treats the statistical approach including the ex-panded uncertainty.\\n3.2.7 lower torque limit of calibration range— the lowest\\nvalue of torque at which a torque measuring system can becalibrated.\\n3.2.8 parasitic torque— Forces that bypass the torque axis\\nand can cause errors in determining the value of the torque.\\n3.2.8.1 Discussion— Usually the result of off axis loading\\n(bending moments) caused by cables, conduit, or hydrauliclines attached to objects that are in the torque path and causesubsequent errors in the measured torque.\\n3.2.9 permissible variation (or tolerance)— in the case of\\ntesting machines\\n, the maximum allowable error in the value of\\nthe quantity indicated.\\n3.2.9.1 Discussion— It is convenient to express permissible\\nvariation in terms of percentage of error.

They may be used in aresearch laboratory to measure material properties, and in aproduction line to qualify a product for shipment. No matterwhat the end use of the machine may be, it is necessary forusers to know the amount of torque that is applied, and that theaccuracy of the torque value is traceable to the SI. Thisstandard provides a procedure to verify these machines anddevices, in order that the indicated torque values may betraceable.

Calibration Devices\\n5.1 Calibration by Standard Weights and Lever Arms—\\nCalibration by the application of standard weights using a leverarm to the torque sensing mechanism of the testing machine,where practicable, is the most accurate method. Its limitationsare: (1)the small range of torque that can be calibrated, (2)the\\nnon-portability of any high capacity standard weights and (3)\\nanalysis of all parasitic torque components.\\n5.2 Calibration by Elastic Calibration Devices— The sec-\\nond method of calibration of testing machines involves mea-surement of the elastic strain or rotation under the torque of atorque transducer or a force transducer/lever arm combination.The elastic calibration devices are less constrained than thestandards referenced in\\n5.1. The design of ﬁxtures and inter-\\nfaces between the calibration device and the machine arecritical. When using elastic torque or force measuring devices,use the devices only over their Class A loading ranges asdetermined by Practice\\nE2428 for elastic torque measuring\\ndevices or Practice E74 for elastic force measuring devices.\\n6. Requirements for Torque Standards\\n6.1 Weights and Lever Arms— Weights and lever arms with\\ntraceability derived from standards of mass, force, length andof speciﬁc measurement uncertainty may be used to applytorque to testing machines. Weights used as force standardsshall be made of rolled, forged, or cast metal. The expandeduncertainty, with a conﬁdence factor of 95% (k=2), for theweight values shall not exceed 0.1 %.\\n6.1.1 The force exerted by a mass in air is determined by:\\nF5MgS12d\\nDD (1)\\nwhere:\\nF = force, N\\nM = true mass of the weight, kg\\ng = local acceleration due to gravity, m/s2,\\nd = air density (1.2 kg/m3), and\\nD = density of the weight in the same units as d\\nNOTE2—Neglecting air buoyancy can cause errors on the order of\\n0.01% to 0.05% depending on the metal the weight is fabricated from. Ifit is neglected, it should be considered in any uncertainty analysis.\\n6.1.2 For the purposes of this standard, gcan be calculated\\nwith a sufficient uncertainty using the following formula.\\ng59.7803 @110.0053 ~sin[ !2#20.000001967 h (2)\\nwhere:\\n[= latitude\\nh= elevation above sea level in meters.\\nNOTE3—Formula 2 corrects for the shape of the earth and elevation\\nabove sea level. The correction for the shape of the earth is a simpliﬁcationof the World Geodetic System 84 Ellipsoidal Gravity Formula. The resultsobtained with the simpliﬁed formula differ by less than 0.0005%. The termthat corrects for altitude, corrects for an increased distance from the centerof the earth and the counter-acting Bouguer effect of localized increasedmass of the earth. The formula assumes a rock density of 2.67 g/cc. If therock density changed by 0.5 g/cc, an error of 0.003 % would result.\\n6.2 The force in customary units exerted by a weight in air\\nis calculated as follows:\\nFc5Mg\\n9.80665 S12d\\nDD (3)\\nwhere:\\nFc = force expressed in customary units, that is, pound\\nforce or kilogram force\\nM = true mass of the weight\\ng = Local acceleration due to gravity, m/s2\\nd = air density (1. 2 kg/m3)\\nD = density of the weight in the same units as d, and\\n9.80665 = The factor converting SI units of force into\\ncustomary units of force; this factor is equal to thevalue of standard gravity. 9.80665 m/s\\n2\\nNOTE4—If M, the mass of the weight is in pounds, the force will be in\\npound-force units (lbf). If M is in kilograms, the force will be inkilogram-force units (kgf). These customary force units are related to thenewton (N), the SI unit of force, by the following relationships:\\n1lbf 54.448222N (4)\\n1kgf 59.80665N\\n~exact ! (5)\\n6.2.1 For use in verifying testing machines, corrections for\\nlocal values of gravity and air buoyancy to weights calibratedin pounds can be made with sufficient accuracy using themultiplying factors from\\nTable 1 . Alternatively the following\\nformula may be used to ﬁnd the multiplying factor, MF.\\nMultiply MFtimes the mass of the weight given in pounds to\\nobtain the value of force in pounds-force, corrected for localgravity and air buoyancy.\\nMF 59.7803 @110.0053 ~sin[!2#20.000001967 h\\n9.8066530.99985\\n(6)\\nwhere:\\n[= latitude\\nh= elevation above sea level in metres.\\nNOTE5—Equation 6 and Table 1 correct for the shape of the earth,\\nelevation above sea level, and air buoyancy. The correction for the shapeof the earth is a simpliﬁcation of the World Geodetic System 84Ellipsoidal Gravity Formula. The results obtained with the simpliﬁedformula differ by less than 0.0005%. The term that corrects for altitude,corrects for an increased distance from the center of the earth and thecounter-acting Bouguer effect of localized increased mass of the earth.The formula assumes a rock density of 2.67 g/cc. If the rock densitychanged by 0.5 g/cc, an error of 0.003 % would result. The largestinaccuracy to be expected, due to extremes in air pressure and humiditywhen using steel weights, is approximately 0.01%. If aluminum weightsare used, errors on the order of 0.03% can result.\\n6.2.2 Standard weights are typically denominated in a unit\\nof mass. When a standard weight has been calibrated such thatit exerts a speciﬁc force under prescribed conditions, it must berecognized that the weight will exert that force only underthose conditions. When used in other ﬁelds of gravity, it isnecessary to correct the calibrated force value by multiplyingthe force value by the value for local gravity and dividing bythe value of gravity for which the weight was calibrated. Anyrequired air buoyancy corrections must also be taken intoaccount.\\nE2624 − 17\\n3\\n\\x0b8&5\\x0c\\x038QLYHUVLGDG\\x03GH\\x03&RVWD\\x035LFD\\x03SXUVXDQW\\x03WR\\x03/LFHQVH\\x03$JUHHPHQW\\x11\\x031R\\x03IXUWKHU\\x03UHSURGXFWLRQV\\x03DXWKRUL]HG\\x11'RZQORDGHG\\x12SULQWHG\\x03E\\\\\\x03&RS\\\\ULJKW\\x03E\\\\\\x03$670\\x03,QW\\nO\\x03\\x0bDOO\\x03ULJKWV\\x03UHVHUYHG\\x0c\\x036XQ\\x03$SU\\x03\\x14\\x17\\x03\\x14\\x19\\x1d\\x15\\x19\\x1d\\x18\\x14\\x0387&\\x03\\x15\\x13\\x15\\x17\"),\n",

Selection of Applied Torques\\n7.1 Determine the upper and lower limits of the torque\\nrange of the testing machine to be calibrated. In no case shallthe calibrated range of torque include torques below 200 timesthe resolution of the torque indicator.\\n7.2 If the lower limit of the torque range is greater or equal\\nto one-tenth the upper limit, calibrate the testing machine byapplying at least ﬁve test torque values, at least two times, withthe difference between any two successive torque value appli-cations being no larger than one-third the difference betweenthe selected maximum and minimum test torque values.Minimum torque values may be one-tenth the maximum torquevalues. Applied torque values on the second run are to beapproximately the same as those on the ﬁrst run. Report allvalues, including the indicator reading, after removal oftorques. Include indicator resolution for the minimum torquevalue.\\nNOTE6—When calibration is done using lever arms and weights, the\\ncombination of standard weights and lever arms may not exactly corre-spond to the desired upper and lower torques to be applied to the testingmachine. In this case torque values that differ from the desired value by62.5 % are acceptable.\\n7.3 When the lower limit of a calibrated torque range is less\\nthan 10 % of the capacity of the range, or where the resolutionof the torque indicator changes automatically and extends orselects ranges without the inﬂuence of an operator, verify thetorque range by applying at least two successive series oftorque values, arranged in overlapping decade groups, suchthat the maximum torque value in one decade is the minimumtorque value in the next higher decade. Starting with theselected minimal torque value in each decade, there are to be at\\nleast ﬁve torque applications, in an approximate ratio of 1:1,2:1, 4:1, 7:1, 10:1 or 1:1, 2.5:1, 5:1, 7.5:1, 10:1, unless themaximum torque value is reached prior to completing alltorque application ratios. The decade’s minimum torque mustbe a torque 200 or more times the resolution of the torqueindicator in each decade. Report all torque values and theirpercent errors. Include the resolution of the torque indicator foreach decade. See\\n3.1.6 andAppendix X1 , which contains a\\nnon-mandatory method for determining resolution.\\nNOTE7—Example: If full scale is 5000 lbf·in. and the minimal torque\\nresolution is 0.04 lbf·in., the minimum calibrated torque would be 8 lbf·in.(0.04 × 200). Instead of decades of 8, 80 and 800 lbf·in., three decades of10, 100 and 1000 lbf·in. could be selected to cover the torque applicationrange. Suitable calibration test torque values would then be approximately10, 20, 40, 70, 100, 200, 400, 700, 1000, 2000, 4000, 5000 lbf·in. Notethat the uppermost decade would not be a complete decade and would beterminated with the maximum torque value in the range. If the alternatedistribution of torques is used, the veriﬁcation torques selected would be10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 2500, 3750, 5000 lbf·in.\\n7.4 Report the resolution of each decade and the percent\\nerror for each test torque value of the two runs.

Some suggested procedures are as\\nfollows.\\nX1.3 Procedure for Analog-Type Torque Indicators :\\nX1.3.1 Typically these devices are not auto-ranging. The\\nresolution should be checked at the lowest calibrated torque ineach torque range (typically 10 % of the torque range).\\nX1.3.2 Divide the pointer width by the distance between\\ntwo adjacent graduation marks at the torque where the resolu-tion is to be ascertained to determine the pointer to graduationratio. If the distance between the two adjacent graduationmarks is less than 0.10 in. (2.5 mm) and the ratio is less than1:5, use 1:5 for the ratio. If the distance between the twoadjacent graduation marks is greater than or equal to 0.10 in.(2.5 mm) and the ratio is less than 1:10, use 1:10 for the ratio.If the ratio is greater than those given in these exceptions, usethe ratio determined. Typical ratios in common usage are 1:1,1:2, 1:5, and 1:10.\\nX1.3.3 Multiply the ratio determined above by the torque\\nrepresented by one graduation to determine the resolution.\\nX1.3.4 Apply as constant a torque as possible where the\\nresolution is to be ascertained to minimize the ﬂuctuation of thetorque indicator. It is recommended that the ﬂuctuation be nomore than twice the resolution determined in the previous step.X1.4 Procedure for Non-Auto-Ranging Digital-Type Torque\\nIndicators :\\nX1.4.1 The resolution should be checked at the lowest\\ncalibrated torque in each torque range (typically 10 % of thetorque range).\\nX1.4.2 Apply a clockwise or counter clockwise torque to a\\nspecimen approximately equal to that at which the resolution isto be ascertained, and slowly change the applied torque.Record the smallest change in torque that can be ascertained asthe resolution. Applying the torque values to a compliantelement, such as a spring or an elastomer, makes it easier toslowly change the applied torque.\\nX1.4.3 Next apply a constant torque at the torque value\\nwhere the resolution is to be ascertained to ensure that thetorque indicator does not ﬂuctuate by more than twice theresolution determined in the previous step. If the indicatorﬂuctuates by more than twice the resolution, the resolutionshall be equal to one-half the range of the ﬂuctuation.\\nX1.5 Procedure for Auto-Ranging-Digital Type Torque In-\\ndicators :\\nX1.5.1 This procedure is the same as that for non-auto-\\nranging digital torque indicators except that the resolution ischecked at the lowest calibrated torque in each decade or atother torques to ensure that the indicator resolution is 200 timessmaller than the torques. Some examples are as follows.\\nX1.5.1.1 A 60 000 lbf·in. capacity machine is to be cali-\\nbrated from 240 lbf·in. up to 60 000 lb·in. The resolutionshould be determined at 240, 2400, and 24 000 lbf·in.\\nX1.5.1.2 A 1000 lbf·in. capacity machine is to be calibrated\\nfrom 5 lbf·in. up to 1000 lbf·in.

SAMPLE UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS FOR TORQUE\\nX2.1 The measurement uncertainty determined using this\\nappendix is the measurement uncertainty of the errors reportedduring veriﬁcation of a testing machine by standard weightsand lever arm. It is not the measurement uncertainty of thetesting machine or test results using the testing machine.\\nX2.2 The torque equation is:\\nT5rFsinΘ (X2.1)\\nwhere:\\nT= applied torque,\\nr= the distance between the point of rotation and the\\napplied force,\\nF= applied force, and\\nΘ= angle between the direction of the applied force and the\\narm of radius r.\\nX2.3 In this example the measurement uncertainty of the\\nreported errors of a testing machine determined during averiﬁcation using Practice\\nE2428 is a combination of multiple\\ncomponents and can be expressed as follows:\\nuT25~FsinΘ!2ur21~rsinΘ!2uF21~rFcosΘ!2uΘ2(X2.2)\\nwhere:\\nuT= the standard uncertainty of T,\\nur= the standard uncertainty of r,\\nuF= the standard uncertainty of F, and\\nuΘ= the standard uncertainty of Θ.\\nX2.4 So the standard uncertainty or 1 sigma value is:\\nuT5=~FsinΘ!2ur21~rsinΘ!2uF21~rFcosΘ!2uΘ2(X2.3)\\nX2.5 So the expanded uncertainty Uis:\\nU5kuT(X2.4)\\nwhere:\\nk= characteristic constant, or coverage factor for XX.XX\\npercent conﬁdence.\\nX2.6 A problem arises for θ=90° because rFcosθ=0, so the\\ncontribution of uθappears to disappear. However θdoes\\ncontribute to the standard uncertainty. Assuming uθequals\\nsome constant Cand provided that 0°< θ<90°, then θ=90° 6C\\nor 90°- C<θ<90°+ C. Given the fact that sin 90°+ C=sin 90°- C,\\nthe torque value at either angle yields a value T=rFsin(90°- C).\\nSo the % error becomes:\\n%ERROR 5rFsin~90°2C!2rFsin90 °\\nrFsin90 °3100 (X2.5)\\nwhich simpliﬁes to:\\n%ERROR 5@rFsin~90°2C!21#3100 (X2.6)\\nX2.6.1 This result can be used to replace ( rFcosθ)2u2\\nθin the\\nabove uTequation or used later when combining other uncer-\\ntainties.X2.7 The following addresses issues surrounding tempera-\\nture. The relationship between the length of the arm rand the\\ntemperature tis:\\nrt25rt1@11α~t22t1!# (X2.7)\\nwhere:\\nrt2= the length of the arm at the time of the torque\\nmeasurement,\\nrt1= the length of the arm rat the time of its calibration,\\nα= thermal expansion coefficient for the arm material,\\nt2= the temperature at the time of the torque measurement,\\nand\\nt1= the temperature at the time of the arm rcalibration.\\nX2.8 So it follows that the uncertainty of the length of the\\narm at any temperature tyields:\\nUr5rtαUt (X2.8)\\nwhere:\\nUr= the uncertainty of the arm rat the time of the torque\\nmeasurement, and\\nUt= the uncertainty of the temperature measurement.\\nX2.8.1 Assuming rt2=20 in., α=6.5ppm/°F for steel and\\nUt=1°F, Ur=0.00013 in., or 0.00065 %. Using the standard\\nuncertainties and the RSS method of combining them, yieldsan even lower contribution to the expanded uncertainty.\\nX2.9 The uncertainty of the weights is such that they are not\\nimpacted by the laboratory environmental conditions.\\nX2.10 The uncertainty due to repeatability during the veri-\\nﬁcation can be assessed by evaluating the differences betweenthe two runs of data.\\nX2.10.1 For each force veriﬁcation point, ﬁnd the sum of\\nthe squares of the differences in error between the ﬁrst andsecond run of that veriﬁcation point and the four veriﬁcationpoints closest to that veriﬁcation point. Divide that sum by tenand take the square root of the result to obtain an estimate ofthe uncertainty due to repeatability during the veriﬁcationprocess.\\nNOTEX2.1—The sum is divided by ten because there are ﬁve pairs of\\nreadings used, and the variance of each pair is equal to the differencedivided by two.\\nN\\nOTEX2.2—Example: The repeatability contribution to the uncertainty\\nof a 2.25 N·m capacity testing machine is to be determined at 40 percentof the range.
